      <description>CoVid-19 Mobility In March 2020 I supported my former team at HU Berlin / RKI, ROCS, by co-analysing the reduction of trips from German citizens following the measures to slow the pandemic spread of CoVid-19. Our analysis showed about a 40% reduction of trip numbers overall, with a stronger reduction of trips between counties than within counties. Ongoing.
 Mission Prescription In December 2019 I attended the hackathon #HackingAMR organised by JPIAMR in Stockholm.</description>
