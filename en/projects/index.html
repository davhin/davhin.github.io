    <h2 id="covid-19-mobility">CoVid-19 Mobility</h2>
<p>In March 2020 I supported my former team at HU Berlin / RKI, ROCS, by co-analysing the reduction of trips from German citizens following the measures to slow the pandemic spread of CoVid-19. Our <a href="http://rocs.hu-berlin.de/covid-19-mobility/">analysis</a> showed about a 40% reduction of trip numbers overall, with a stronger reduction of trips between counties than within counties. <strong>Ongoing.</strong></p>

<h2 id="mission-prescription">Mission Prescription</h2>
<p>In December 2019 I attended the hackathon #HackingAMR organised by JPIAMR in Stockholm. The goal of the event was to develop and prototype data-driven products to further the fight against antimicrobial resistance. Team <a href="https://jpiamr-mission-prescription.idalab-dev.de/">Mission Prescription</a> focused on increasing the quality of antibiotic prescriptions in primary care by utilising local community-based antimicrobial resistance data to recommend the most appropriate antibiotic to prescribing physicians. We <a href="https://www.jpiamr.eu/team-mission-prescription-is-the-winner-of-hacking-amr-2019/">won</a> 1st place at the event, and are currently evaluating how best to push our idea forward with the help of experienced mentors from JPIAMR. <strong>Ongoing.</strong></p>

<p><em>I enjoy working on practical projects with the chance to learn something new about the world and myself. One field I would love to explore is the relationship of human life with data science and evidence-based decision making (&ldquo;truth&rdquo;). Please contact me if you have any ideas for collaboration!</em></p>
